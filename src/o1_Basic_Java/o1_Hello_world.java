    Package- Used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory.

    Static:
    - Generally, you have to make an object of the class in order to run the member function of that class.
    - But, here we can run main function directly (without making object of this class)
    - Because the "static" keyword enables the function to act as a function which is independent of the class,
      and reside inside the class at the same time.


    Naming conventions:
    * Must not begin with a digit
    * Case sensitive (Void allowed)
    * No keyword (like void)
    * No white spaces
    * Can contain ($ , _ , alphabets , digits)


    Class               -   PascalConvention
    Function/Variable   -   camelCaseConvention
